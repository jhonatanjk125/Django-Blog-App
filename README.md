<h2 align="center">What is this project?</h2>
<p> This is a fully functional website created using Python, Django, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>.

<h2 align="center">How to use this app?</h2>
<p align="justify"> This project was deployed using DigitalOcean. you should be able to check it at https://djangoblogapp-cxsp.onrender.com/.</p>
<p>This is a fully featured website including back-end functionalities, some of the different things it includes are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A model with the website metadata so the information can be changed at any point using the Django admin panel (title, description, about information...).</p>
<p>- Featured post completely handled from the database which means it can be changed from the Django admin panel at any point.</p>
<p>- Top posts being fetched from the database and sorted based on number of views.</p>
<p>- Recent posts being fetched from the database and sorted base on last updated field included in the model.</p>
<p>- Authentication.</p>
<p>- Session handling and context processing (a little bit more about that in another post).</p>
<p>- Conditional logic based on whether the user is authenticated or not (for instance, adding additional links on the menu bar to check the posts that you have liked/bookmarked).</p>
<p>- Conditional logic based on context processors</p>
<p>- Both comments and replies in each individual posts are being rendered with the respective logic required to put them where they belong (either a comment or a reply to a specific comment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But definitely out of all of those the coolest feature of them all has to be the <b>dark mode</b>! Go ahead and give it a try, you can just <b>click the toggle on the top right side and you'll see the magic</b>. Alright, it might not be as impressive as you might have hoped but it was the feature i had the most fun working on. There are more smaller features which I might have forgotten or I might have thought they were not as important but I hope you get the idea.</p>
